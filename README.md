# slacGene
### SVG Large Annotated Circular Gene map drawing program

A simple, extensible, Perl script for producing figures of circular gene maps.

* Originally written to produce a custom figure of SNP coverage and large deletions in a study of human mitochondrial DNA (Fig. 3, ![McCrow, Peterson, et. al, 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pros.23126/full))
* Because it is a single Perl script with no external dependencies, it is easy to run, and easy to further customize
* SVG is used because it is a scalable format allowing for very small representations of gene maps or highly magnified regions with unlimited resolution

Examples
--------
